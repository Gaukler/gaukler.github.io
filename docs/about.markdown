Hello there! My name is Alexander Gauggel. I'm currently doing a Master's in computational visualistics at the University of Koblenz-Landau.  
My main interest is in real-time rendering and all the systems connected to it, like memory management, threading and asset pipelines. 
I'm especially interested in learning about the nitty-griddy details of hardware and using that knowledge to make things run fast.
